Welcome to _Curse of Strahd_, an immersive Dungeons & Dragons campaign set in the dark and misty land of Barovia. This gothic horror adventure takes you through haunted forests, eerie villages, and the ominous Castle Ravenloft, where the ancient vampire lord Strahd von Zarovich rules. As adventurers, you will face terrifying creatures, unravel grim mysteries, and make choices that could shape the fate of the landâ€”and your survival. Whether you're new to Barovia or a seasoned traveler, prepare for a story of suspense, danger, and intrigue where your courage and wits will be tested.

#### Setting Expectations

**_Tone_**. This will be a heroic fantasy adventure in a dark fantasy/gothic horror setting. Your character should be a hero, or have the potential to swiftly become a hero when faced with a life-or-death situation. Be prepared to cooperate and collaborate with the other players in order to succeed.

**_Theme_**. While this campaign will not explore or focus upon your character's personal backstory, you should allow the campaign's characters and setting to inspire your character to confront their own regrets, traumas, flaws, and fears.

**_Engagement_**. This campaign takes place in a setting with a deep history, including complex relationships between several dozen non-player characters. You should expect to notes and take a sincere interest in the lore of this world.

**_Tactics & Difficulty._**. This campaign has been balanced to present a challenging, but fair gameplay experience. However, to succeed, you will often need to recruit additional allies while avoiding alienating potential enemies. Consider the consequences of your actions carefully, and avoid taking actions without careful consideration.

**_Roleplay_**. This campaign is primarily driven by the stories of its non-player characters, and their relationships to the party. Be prepared to form meaningful relationships with the characters you encounter, and allow yourself to emotionally invest in those characters' success.

**_Rewards_**. Treasure, magic items, and other material rewards will be far more scarce than in an ordinary fantasy campaign. Instead, most rewards will take the form of allies, information, and new story hooks, with experience points awarded for narrative milestones you achieve as you proceed through the campaign.

**_Narrative_**. The campaign begins with a linear structure, but soon evolves into a more expansive sandbox. Be prepared to balance and prioritize multiple quests, including many with clear deadlines.

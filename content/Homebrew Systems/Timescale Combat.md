title: Timescale Combat
---
#### **System Overview**

- **Purpose**: Combat can often feel slow and tedious when players take too long to decide their actions. The 1:10 timescale helps maintain the tension and pace.
    
- **Rule**: Each player has 60 seconds to decide on their actions during combat. If they need to clarify rules or mechanics, they get an additional minute. Failure to act within the time limit results in their character hesitating and losing their turn.
    
- **DM Flexibility**:
    - The timer pauses for questions about enemy positions or environment (DM's responsibility).
    - Clarification questions about game mechanics are allowed but must be kept brief (maximum 2 minutes).
      
- **RP Impact**: This rule adds a sense of urgency and chaos to combat, reflecting the stress of battle. Players are encouraged to act quickly, leading to more spontaneous and less optimized actions. It also promotes better communication and strategy development over time.

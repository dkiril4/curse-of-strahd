title: Dynamic Out-of-Combat Strategizing
---
#### **System Overview**

- **Purpose**: Even when planning outside of direct combat, tension should remain to keep the game exciting and realistic.
    
- **Rule**: When players are strategizing near enemies, every minute spent planning triggers another stealth roll or random encounter check. Strategic moments should feel dynamic, not static, with the risk of enemies moving or gaining reinforcements.
    
- **DM Flexibility**:
    - Limit strategic discussions to 10-15 minutes to avoid downtime and maintain game flow.
      
- **RP Impact**: Keeps tension high even when players are out of direct combat. The risk of being discovered adds urgency to decision-making, making players weigh the pros and cons of acting with an incomplete plan versus risking surprise or discovery.


#### **Examples**

- **Example 1**: The party is sneaking into an enemy camp and begins to strategize on how to take out the guards. After a couple of minutes, the DM asks for a stealth roll because they’ve been deliberating too long. One of the players rolls poorly, and the DM says a guard notices something suspicious but hasn’t sounded the alarm yet, raising the tension.
    
- **Example 2**: While scouting a dungeon with a _Familiar_, the party spends too much time discussing tactics. The DM rolls for a random encounter, and they find out that a group of patrolling orcs is heading toward their position. The party must now adjust their plan and deal with the sudden threat.
    
- **Example 3**: The party is discussing how to ambush a bandit leader when the DM says, "As you’re talking, you notice the bandit camp’s layout has changed slightly. Some guards have moved closer to your position." Now the party must decide whether to strike immediately or retreat and reevaluate their plan, knowing the risk of waiting.

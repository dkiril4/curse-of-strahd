title: Realistic Injuries
---
#### **System Overview**

- **Purpose**: Add depth to combat, healing, and survival, introducing lasting injuries that distinguish between magical and non-magical healing.
    
- **Rule**
	- **Injury Saving Throw**: When taking damage equal to half your max HP from a single source, roll a DC 15 Injury Saving Throw. Failure results in a major injury.
	- **Injury Effects**: Injured characters have disadvantage on concentration checks until treated and completing a long rest. Magical healing can complicate recovery.
    
- **Healing and Medical Treatment**
	- **Magical Healing**:
	    - Potions and spells accelerate the natural recovery of the body but may cause complications without medical expertise.
	    - Roll a DC 10 Constitution saving throw after magical healing.
	        - **Success**: Injury severity is reduced.
	        - **Failure**: Injury persists, with potential complications.
	        - **Medicine Proficiency**: Grants advantage on saving throws.
	- **Non-Magical Healing (Medical)**:
	    - Slower but risk-free. Injuries heal naturally with no complications.
	- **Rest-Based Recovery**:
	    - **Minor Injuries**: Heal after 1 long rest.
	    - **Major Injuries**: Downgrade to minor after 1 long rest, fully heal after 3 long rests.
      
- **RP Impact**: Players will experience the consequences of injuries in battle and afterward, making combat feel riskier and more immersive. Decisions about healing will impact the narrative, with magical healing becoming a trade-off between speed and complications.1

**Scarring:** 
Any external scarring related to blunt trauma is likely to result only from surgical intervention undertaken to resolve complications. Consequently, the scars are likely to be thin, raised lines where deliberate incisions were made.

**Lingering Consequences:** 
In case of broken bones, the application of magic to accelerate the healing process often leads to a malunion of the fracture unless measures are taken properly to set the bones beforehand. 

Magically accelerated healing does not resolve the underlying complications of internal injuries in the abdominal or chest cavities. After being magically healed, you have your movement halved or make attacks with disadvantage depending on the initial consequence of your injury. These complications remain until the injury causing them is treated surgically.

A skull fracture is often accompanied by a concussion, which, during magical healing, may have its symptoms uncomfortably accelerated. After you receive magical healing while concussed, you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls and saving throws until the symptoms are treated medicinally and you finish a long rest.

**Scarring:** 
Scars caused by burns are often noticeably discolored in tones of pinks, reds and purples. They may appear patterned with ripple-like textures. Lightning burns may have a fractal appearance, following the path that electricity took through the body and resembling natural lightning.

**Lingering Consequences:** 
Magical means of accelerating the healing process may cause contraction and a loss in range of movement when applied to major burn wounds. After being magically healed, you now either have your movement halved or make attacks with disadvantage depending on the initial consequence of your injury. This complication remains until the injury is treated medicinally.

**Scarring:** 
Any external scarring related to concussive blast injuries is likely to result only from surgical intervention undertaken to resolve medical complications. Consequently, the scars are likely to be thin, raised lines where deliberate incisions were made.

**Lingering Consequences:** 
In the case of dislocated joints, the joint must be relocated by traditional means before magic can be used to accelerate the healing process.

Magically accelerated healing does not resolve the underlying complications of internal injuries in the abdominal or chest cavities. After being magically healed, you have your movement halved or make attacks with disadvantage depending on the initial consequence of your injury. These complications remain until the injury causing them is treated surgically.

Attempts to magically heal a ruptured eye cannot restore the structure and the eye will need to be surgically removed and medicinally treated to prevent infection.

**Scarring:** 
Scars caused by lacerations or punctures are often either raised or sunken from the skin. They may appear shiny in contrast to undamaged skin and may also be several shades paler or darker.

**Lingering Consequences:** 
Magical means of accelerating the healing process may increase the change of infection when applied to major cut or stab wounds and does not replenish lost blood.

After being magically healed, you must make a **DC 12 Constitution Saving Throw** during your next long rest. On a failure, the injury has become infected and either your movement is halved or you make attacks with disadvantage, depending on the initial consequence of your injury. The complication remains for 14 days or until the infection is treated medicinally.

**Scarring:** 
Scars left by freeze injuries are most often pale pink in tone. They may appear shallowly sunken and take on a broad, rounded pattern. Very deep freeze injuries often cause necrosis, leading to amputation of the impacted limb.

**Lingering Consequences:** 
The accelerated rewarming that accompanies magical healing of freeze injuries is extremely painful. After receiving magical healing, your movement is halved and you have disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls. This complication remains until you receive magical treatment and finish a short rest. In the case of tissue death, you must make a DC **12 Constitution Saving Throw** during your next long rest. On a failure, the injury has become infected and either your movement is halved or you make attacks with disadvantage depending on the limb that has been inured. This complication remains until the limb is surgically removed.

| 1            | Mana saturation in the face                       | Immediately fall unconscious in a stable condition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

**Scarring:** 
Mana scarring typically takes the form of contrasting albanistic or melanistic discoloration of the skin, hair or eyes, but can also appear in metallic tones like gold and silver. The pattern can sometimes take on unusual shapes that reflect the magical nature of the injury suffered.

**Lingering Consequences:** 
When someone has suffered a significant magical injury, their system becomes overwhelmed by a toxic concentration of mana. Accelerating the healing process through magic can compound this problem by introducing even more mana to the nervous system. After being magically healed, you have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. The complication remains until the patient is treated medicinally and finishes a long rest.

**Scarring:** 
Mental assaults typically do not leave any visible scarring, however, an incidental concurrent mana saturation may leave a mark in the form of discoloration of the hair or eyes.

**Lingering Consequences:** 
Since mental injuries, by their nature, lack a physical wound, the use of magic to accelerate healing is of limited use when attempting to repair psychic damage. After being magically healed you become fatigued, and gain disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws. IN the case of a concussion, you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls and saving throws. These complications last until the symptoms are treated medicinally and you finish a long rest.

| 1            | Severe poisoning and tissue death in the arm or leg     | Your proficiency bonus and ability modifiers are reduced to 0 for all Strength and Dexterity checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.                                                                                           |

**Scarring:** 
Scars associated with damaging toxicity are often the result of punctures or lacerations through which the poison or venom was introduced to the body. They can be raised or sunken from the skin. They may appear shiny in contrast to undamaged surrounding skin and may also be several shades paler or darker. Some toxins cause necrosis, leading to the removal of the dead tissue and significantly sunken scars. In severe cases it may even lead to limb amputation.

**Lingering Consequences:** 
Magically accelerating the healing process is particularly dangerous for a patient suffering from severe toxicity, as venoms and poisons often inhibit or hijack the body's natural healing processes. In all cases magical healing will uncomfortably accelerate the painful symptoms of the toxicity, and in some extreme cases can speed the patient more quickly to their death. After receiving magical healing, your movement is halved and you have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks that use Strength or Dexterity. These complications remain until the underlying poison is medically treated and you finish a long rest. Spells specifically intended to cure poison can end the effects of the toxicity immediately. In the case of tissue death, you must make a DC12 Constitution saving throw during your next long rest. On a failure, the injury has become infected and either your movement is halved or you make attacks with disadvantage, depending on the limb that has been injured. This complication remains until the limb is surgically removed.

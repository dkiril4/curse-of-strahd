title: Assist with Proficiency
---
#### **System Overview**

 **Purpose**: To encourage more strategic teamwork by requiring players to justify their assistance based on proficiency, ensuring that assistance is meaningful and tied to the character’s strengths.
    
- **Rule**: A player can only assist another character with an ability check if:
	- They have proficiency in the relevant skill, **or**
	- They can justify how their proficiency in a different skill could logically aid in the situation.
    
- **DM Flexibility**: The DM has the discretion to allow or deny assistance based on the justification provided by the player. If a player suggests an unconventional use of a skill, the DM can rule whether it reasonably fits the context of the situation
      
- **RP Impact**: This rule encourages players to think creatively about how their characters’ strengths can be applied to different challenges. It also promotes roleplaying opportunities as players need to justify their actions in a narrative context, leading to more immersive and cooperative gameplay.

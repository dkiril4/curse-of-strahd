title: Answering "Will it Work?"
---
#### **System Overview**

- **Purpose**: Instead of breaking immersion by delving into game mechanics, answer player questions from their character’s knowledge and experience.
    
- **Rule**: When a player asks if something will work, provide an in-character response based on what their character would know. This adds realism and forces players to make decisions with limited information.
    
- **DM Flexibility:
    - **Reward Creativity**: Even if the creative attempt fails to achieve its full intent, find a smaller way to allow it to impact the encounter. Think of minor consequences or secondary benefits.
	- **Narrative Outcome**: Add a narrative result that impacts the story or scene—maybe the action didn’t succeed, but it created an opportunity or revealed new information that wasn’t known before.
	- **Encourage Risk-Taking**: Reward players with small victories to encourage more creative problem-solving, instead of always focusing on the mechanical success or failure.
      
- **RP Impact**: Characters feel more authentic, with their own knowledge and limitations. Players are encouraged to take risks based on their character's experience, leading to exciting moments and character flaws being highlighted.

#### **Examples**

- **Example 1**: The wizard asks, "If I cast _Thunderwave_ near the cave entrance, will the rocks collapse and trap the enemies?" The DM responds: "Your wizard has never used _Thunderwave_ in this way before and isn’t sure if the rocks are loose enough to collapse. If you want to try, roll Arcana to estimate the risk."
    
- **Example 2**: A ranger wants to know if they can use _Hunter’s Mark_ on a distant figure they can barely see. The DM says: "Your ranger is experienced with long-distance targets and feels confident that they can mark the figure, but it's difficult due to the distance. Make a Perception check to focus."
    
- **Example 3**: The rogue wants to disarm a trap by jamming the mechanism with their sword. The DM responds: "Your rogue knows from experience that this is a risky move, and while it's possible, there's a high chance of damaging your sword. Do you want to try anyway?"

#### **Examples - Partial Failure**

###### **Casting a Spell in a Creative Way**
- **Scenario**: A wizard wants to cast _Mage Hand_ to pull a lever across a room, but the DM rules that the lever is too heavy.
- **Partial Failure**: Instead of fully failing, the DM allows the _Mage Hand_ to jostle the lever slightly, triggering part of the mechanism and causing a door to crack open slightly, revealing another way to interact with the environment. The wizard now knows the lever is too heavy, but they’ve discovered a new opening that can be exploited.

###### **Using the Environment to Attack**
- **Scenario**: A fighter decides to knock over a large barrel to block a hallway, preventing enemies from advancing.
- **Partial Failure**: The barrel rolls unevenly and doesn't block the hallway completely, but it creates difficult terrain that slows down enemy movement. The enemies still advance, but at a slower rate, giving the party more time to act. The player’s creativity has some effect even if it wasn’t fully successful.

###### **Trying to Intimidate or Bluff**
- **Scenario**: A bard attempts to intimidate an enemy leader into surrendering by making a dramatic speech and waving a torch near flammable materials.
- **Partial Failure**: The leader isn’t fully cowed, but they hesitate, buying the party a round of action before the fight resumes. The hesitation causes some of the lower-ranking enemies to shift uneasily, perhaps giving the bard advantage on a future intimidation check.

###### **Using a Non-Combat Spell Creatively**
- **Scenario**: A druid tries to cast _Entangle_ in a room with a rocky floor, hoping to bind the enemies in place.
- **Partial Failure**: The plants don’t fully entangle the enemies due to the hard terrain, but they create cover for the druid and their allies. The enemies are not trapped but have disadvantage on their next ranged attacks due to the obstructed line of sight.

###### **A Risky Acrobatics or Athletics Check**
- **Scenario**: A rogue tries to jump from a high ledge onto an enemy below, hoping to land on them and knock them prone.
- **Partial Failure**: The rogue doesn’t land directly on the enemy, but they manage to knock them off balance, forcing them to use their next action to recover. The rogue takes some minor fall damage but gains positioning and provides an opening for an ally to attack.

###### **Using an Unusual Object in Combat**
- **Scenario**: The party finds themselves in a banquet hall, and the barbarian wants to grab a large table and throw it at the advancing enemies to crush them.
- **Partial Failure**: The table doesn’t completely flatten the enemies, but it smashes into them and creates an obstacle, forcing the enemies to take a longer route or giving the party cover from ranged attacks.

###### **Unconventional Spell Usage**
- **Scenario**: A sorcerer wants to use _Gust of Wind_ to push a heavy boulder onto enemies below.
- **Partial Failure**: The wind isn’t strong enough to move the boulder completely, but it dislodges it slightly, causing a cascade of smaller rocks to fall on the enemies, dealing minor damage and making them more vulnerable to future attacks by removing some of their cover.

###### **Making a Risky Shot**
- **Scenario**: An archer wants to shoot an arrow through a narrow gap between two moving walls to hit a distant target.
- **Partial Failure**: The arrow doesn't hit the enemy directly, but it strikes a support beam, causing debris to fall near the enemy, distracting them and giving the next attacker advantage on their roll.

###### **Using a Spell in a Non-Standard Way**
- **Scenario**: A cleric tries to use _Sacred Flame_ to light a series of torches around a room instead of targeting an enemy, hoping to illuminate hidden threats.
- **Partial Failure**: The spell doesn’t ignite all the torches, but it does light a few, revealing parts of the room and giving partial vision of a previously hidden trap or enemy.

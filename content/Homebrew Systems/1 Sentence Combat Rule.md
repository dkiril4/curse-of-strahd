title: 1 Sentence Combat Rule
---
#### **System Overview**

- **Purpose**: Limit over-strategizing during combat to keep the action moving and prevent one player from dominating tactics.
    
- **Rule**: Each player is allowed to say one sentence per round of combat to communicate with their party. This sentence can be said at any point but must remain brief.
    
- **RP Impact**: Encourages in-character communication and forces players to think quickly and strategically with limited time. It also reduces “backseat” strategizing, allowing all players to contribute to tactics equally. This fosters team synergy and the development of a "party playbook" of strategies for future use.


#### **Examples**

- **Example 1**: The paladin, seeing that the wizard is about to cast _Fireball_, shouts, "Elyse, watch out for my aura!" This brief sentence lets the wizard know to avoid targeting the area where the paladin is protecting the party with an aura effect, keeping the communication brief but impactful.
    
- **Example 2**: The rogue spots the boss enemy starting to cast a spell and yells, "Disrupt the caster!" to the barbarian. The barbarian player, who goes later in initiative, now knows to focus on interrupting the spellcaster without a detailed strategy discussion.
    
- **Example 3**: During an intense fight, the fighter says, "I'll hold the doorway!" This short communication is enough for the party to know the fighter will tank at the chokepoint, and they can adjust their actions accordingly without over-complicating the strategy.
